# Implement a supervised learning model (regression) to predict the energy consumption of buildings in the city of Seattle

Clean Data, handle missing values

Create a preprocessor pipeline: encoder, scaler

Create a feature engineering pipeline: PolynomialFeature, SelectKbest, PCA

Train different machine learning algorithms (ElasticNet, Gradient boost, Random Forest Regressor)

Optimize Hyperparameters

Identify feature importance
